HowTo use PPA and autoppa
=================

Require:
- Be admin of the team
- Install package dput seahorse and devscript
- Had a OpenPGP key uploaded to Launchpad

Using autoPPA:

You can use this repository for Ubuntu
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/autoppa/ubuntu gutsy universe
deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/autoppa/ubuntu gutsy universe

For Debian, add "deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/autoppa/ubuntu gutsy universe"
Download source : apt-get source autoppa
Build autoppa : dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
Install the deb

1.Set up the branch
To build the package, you should create a new branch : bzr branch http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~awn-testing/awn/awn-core-testing awn-core-testing-package

2. Configure your dput configuration
Edit a .dput.conf file in your home directory with this type of configuration

[awn-testing]
fqdn = ppa.launchpad.net
method = ftp
incoming = ~awn-testing/ubuntu/
login = anonymous
allow_unsigned_uploads = 0

3. Configure autoppa
Edit a .autoppa.conf in your home directory with this type of configuration

[avant-window-navigator-testing]
email = John Doe <john.doe@mail.com>
branch = /path/to/the/branch/awn-core-testing-package
repository = /path/to/the/branch/awn-core-testing-package
ppa = awn-testing
releases = edgy feisty gutsy hardy

4. Configure devscripts
Backup your devscripts if you have one : cp ~/.devscripts ~/.devscripts-backup
Create the devscripts file : cp /usr/share/devscripts/conf.default ~/.devscripts
Edit ~/.devscripts, find the ‘# DEBUILD_PRESERVE_ENVVARS=""‘ line and
replace it with: 
DEBUILD_PRESERVE_ENVVARS="DISPLAY"

5. Use autoPPA
To build : 
 - Launch the command for example : "EDITOR=nano autoppa avant-window-navigator-testing-0.2.2~bzr156-1"
 - Write a changelog (like "Build Revision 156")
 - Ctrl+o to save, Ctrl+x to quit and launch the build
avant-window-navigator-testing : the name of the package (can't be changed)
-0.2.2 : the version
~bzr156 : the revision of the branch
-1 : the revision of the package
To upload a new package, the revision must be higher (first the branch, after the package)
Examples : 
0.2.2~bzr156-1 is higher than 0.2.2~bzr155-4
0.2.2~bzr157-2 is higher than 0.2.2~bzr157-1
The final version will be avant-window-navigator-testing-0.2.2~bzr156-ubuntu1-1
where ubuntu is the version of ubuntu
