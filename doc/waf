waf support
===========

Statut : Imcomplete

TODO
 - Add pyawn directory
 - Add awn.pc.in support
 - src/ dbus stuff : waf doesn't name it as autotools do
 - libawn/ Generate awn-enum-types.{c|h}
 - Others stuff (check the #TODO in waf files)
 - Test installation

Principe
 - All in Python
 - Files are build in a subdirectory (build/) So you can use autotools or waf
 - Basic command : ./waf configure ./waf build (-p for nice progress bar) ./waf install ./waf uninstall ./waf dist ./waf clean
 - waf is a executable script which extract tools for building
 - wscript and wscript_build are files for configure build (like configure.in and Makefile.am)
 - You can put all instruction in the top directory wscript but to simplify debug, I put some wscript_build in subdirectory
 - To migrate a directory, just try to write the Makefile into waf.
