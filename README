Installation: Backends
======================

Awn can be compiled to work with various desktop-specific backends for file transfer, .desktop file manipulation and configuration. Here's a list of backeds:

  - gnome - This uses gnome-vfs, libgnome-desktop and gconf
  - xfce4 - thuner-vfs, eggdesktop, GKeyFile
  - agnostic - gio, eggdesktop, GKeyfile

You can switch between backends using --with-backend=BACKEND, where BACKEND=gnome, xfce4 or agnostic. The default backend it gnome.

Usage
=====

You can launch Awn from Applications->Accessories->Avant Window Navigator. You
can edit preferences by either launching Awn Manager from System->Preferences->Awn Manager, or right-clicking on the far left or right of the main bar, and selecting 'Preferences'.

If Awn Manager does not start, please run `awn-manager` from the terminal to 
see if any dependancies are missing.
