-Installation Instructions

-notice and this notice are preserved.  This file is offered as-is,
-without warranty of any kind.
-
-Basic Installation
-==================
-
-   Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
-configure, build, and install this package.  The following
-more-detailed instructions are generic; see the `README' file for
-instructions specific to this package.  Some packages provide this
-`INSTALL' file but do not implement all of the features documented
-below.  The lack of an optional feature in a given package is not
-necessarily a bug.  More recommendations for GNU packages can be found
-in *note Makefile Conventions: (standards)Makefile Conventions.
-
-   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
-various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
-those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
-It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
-definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
-you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a
-file `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for
-debugging `configure').
-
-   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'
-and enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves
-the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  Caching is
-disabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale
-cache files.
-
-   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
-to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
-diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
-be considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at
-some point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you
-may remove or edit it.
-
-   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create
-`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You need `configure.ac' if
-you want to change it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version
-of `autoconf'.
-
-   The simplest way to compile this package is:
-
-  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
-     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.
-
-     Running `configure' might take a while.  While running, it prints
-     some messages telling which features it is checking for.
-
-  2. Type `make' to compile the package.
-
-  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
-     the package, generally using the just-built uninstalled binaries.
-
-  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
-     documentation.  When installing into a prefix owned by root, it is
-     recommended that the package be configured and built as a regular
-     user, and only the `make install' phase executed with root
-     privileges.
-
-  5. Optionally, type `make installcheck' to repeat any self-tests, but
-     this time using the binaries in their final installed location.
-     This target does not install anything.  Running this target as a
-     regular user, particularly if the prior `make install' required
-     root privileges, verifies that the installation completed
-     correctly.
-
-  6. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
-     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
-     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
-     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
-     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
-     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
-     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
-     with the distribution.
-
-  7. Often, you can also type `make uninstall' to remove the installed
-     files again.  In practice, not all packages have tested that
-     uninstallation works correctly, even though it is required by the
-     GNU Coding Standards.
-
-  8. Some packages, particularly those that use Automake, provide `make
-     distcheck', which can by used by developers to test that all other
-     targets like `make install' and `make uninstall' work correctly.
-     This target is generally not run by end users.
-
-Compilers and Options
-=====================
-
-   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
-the `configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help'
-for details on some of the pertinent environment variables.
-
-   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
-by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
-is an example:
-
-     ./configure CC=c99 CFLAGS=-g LIBS=-lposix
-
-   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.
-
-Compiling For Multiple Architectures
-====================================
-
-   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
-same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
-own directory.  To do this, you can use GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
-directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
-the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
-source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.  This
-is known as a "VPATH" build.
-
-   With a non-GNU `make', it is safer to compile the package for one
-architecture at a time in the source code directory.  After you have
-installed the package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before
-reconfiguring for another architecture.
-
-   On MacOS X 10.5 and later systems, you can create libraries and
-executables that work on multiple system types--known as "fat" or
-"universal" binaries--by specifying multiple `-arch' options to the
-compiler but only a single `-arch' option to the preprocessor.  Like
-this:
-
-     ./configure CC="gcc -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" \
-                 CXX="g++ -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" \
-                 CPP="gcc -E" CXXCPP="g++ -E"
-
-   This is not guaranteed to produce working output in all cases, you
-may have to build one architecture at a time and combine the results
-using the `lipo' tool if you have problems.
-
-Installation Names
-==================
-
-   By default, `make install' installs the package's commands under
-`/usr/local/bin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You
-can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
-`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX', where PREFIX must be an
-absolute file name.
-
-   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
-architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
-pass the option `--exec-prefix=PREFIX' to `configure', the package uses
-PREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
-Documentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.
-
-   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
-options like `--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular
-kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
-you can set and what kinds of files go in them.  In general, the
-default for these options is expressed in terms of `${prefix}', so that
-specifying just `--prefix' will affect all of the other directory
-specifications that were not explicitly provided.
-
-   The most portable way to affect installation locations is to pass the
-correct locations to `configure'; however, many packages provide one or
-both of the following shortcuts of passing variable assignments to the
-`make install' command line to change installation locations without
-having to reconfigure or recompile.
-
-   The first method involves providing an override variable for each
-affected directory.  For example, `make install
-prefix=/alternate/directory' will choose an alternate location for all
-directory configuration variables that were expressed in terms of
-`${prefix}'.  Any directories that were specified during `configure',
-but not in terms of `${prefix}', must each be overridden at install
-time for the entire installation to be relocated.  The approach of
-makefile variable overrides for each directory variable is required by
-the GNU Coding Standards, and ideally causes no recompilation.
-However, some platforms have known limitations with the semantics of
-shared libraries that end up requiring recompilation when using this
-method, particularly noticeable in packages that use GNU Libtool.
-
-   The second method involves providing the `DESTDIR' variable.  For
-example, `make install DESTDIR=/alternate/directory' will prepend
-`/alternate/directory' before all installation names.  The approach of
-`DESTDIR' overrides is not required by the GNU Coding Standards, and
-does not work on platforms that have drive letters.  On the other hand,
-it does better at avoiding recompilation issues, and works well even
-when some directory options were not specified in terms of `${prefix}'
-at `configure' time.
-
-Optional Features
-=================
-
-   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
-with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
-option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.
-
-   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
-`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
-They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
-is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
-`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
-package recognizes.
-
-   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
-find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
-you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
-`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.
-
-   Some packages offer the ability to configure how verbose the
-execution of `make' will be.  For these packages, running `./configure
---enable-silent-rules' sets the default to minimal output, which can be
-overridden with `make V=1'; while running `./configure
---disable-silent-rules' sets the default to verbose, which can be
-overridden with `make V=0'.
-
-Particular systems
-==================
-
-   On HP-UX, the default C compiler is not ANSI C compatible.  If GNU
-CC is not installed, it is recommended to use the following options in
-order to use an ANSI C compiler:
-
-     ./configure CC="cc -Ae -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500"
-
-and if that doesn't work, install pre-built binaries of GCC for HP-UX.
-
-   HP-UX `make' updates targets which have the same time stamps as
-their prerequisites, which makes it generally unusable when shipped
-generated files such as `configure' are involved.  Use GNU `make'
-instead.
-
-   On OSF/1 a.k.a. Tru64, some versions of the default C compiler cannot
-parse its `<wchar.h>' header file.  The option `-nodtk' can be used as
-a workaround.  If GNU CC is not installed, it is therefore recommended
-to try
-
-     ./configure CC="cc"
-
-and if that doesn't work, try
-
-     ./configure CC="cc -nodtk"
-
-   On Solaris, don't put `/usr/ucb' early in your `PATH'.  This
-directory contains several dysfunctional programs; working variants of
-these programs are available in `/usr/bin'.  So, if you need `/usr/ucb'
-in your `PATH', put it _after_ `/usr/bin'.
-
-   On Haiku, software installed for all users goes in `/boot/common',
-not `/usr/local'.  It is recommended to use the following options:
-
-     ./configure --prefix=/boot/common
-
-Specifying the System Type
-==========================
-
-   There may be some features `configure' cannot figure out
-automatically, but needs to determine by the type of machine the package
-will run on.  Usually, assuming the package is built to be run on the
-_same_ architectures, `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
-a message saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the
-`--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
-type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:
-
-     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM
-
-where SYSTEM can have one of these forms:
-
-     OS
-     KERNEL-OS
-
-   See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
-`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
-need to know the machine type.
-
-   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should
-use the option `--target=TYPE' to select the type of system they will
-produce code for.
-
-   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a
-platform different from the build platform, you should specify the
-"host" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will
-eventually be run) with `--host=TYPE'.
-
-Sharing Defaults
-================
-
-   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
-you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
-default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
-`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
-`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
-`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
-A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.
-
-Defining Variables
-==================
-
-   Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the
-environment passed to `configure'.  However, some packages may run
-configure again during the build, and the customized values of these
-variables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set
-them in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:
-
-     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc
-
-causes the specified `gcc' to be used as the C compiler (unless it is
-overridden in the site shell script).
-
-Unfortunately, this technique does not work for `CONFIG_SHELL' due to
-an Autoconf limitation.  Until the limitation is lifted, you can use
-this workaround:
-
-     CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash ./configure CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash
-
-`configure' Invocation
-======================
-
-   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
-operates.
-
-`--help'
-`-h'
-     Print a summary of all of the options to `configure', and exit.
-
-`--help=short'
-`--help=recursive'
-     Print a summary of the options unique to this package's
-     `configure', and exit.  The `short' variant lists options used
-     only in the top level, while the `recursive' variant lists options
-     also present in any nested packages.
-
-`--version'
-`-V'
-     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
-     script, and exit.
-
-`--cache-file=FILE'
-     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,
-     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to
-     disable caching.
-
-`--config-cache'
-`-C'
-     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.
-
-`--quiet'
-`--silent'
-`-q'
-     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
-     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
-     messages will still be shown).
-
-`--srcdir=DIR'
-     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
-     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.
-
-`--prefix=DIR'
-     Use DIR as the installation prefix.  *note Installation Names::
-     for more details, including other options available for fine-tuning
-     the installation locations.
-
-`--no-create'
-`-n'
-     Run the configure checks, but stop before creating any output
-     files.
-
-`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
-`configure --help' for more details.
